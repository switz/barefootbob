      <p>On January 7th, a friend of the entire Phish community was taken from this world much too early. Robert Eckhart (known by many as Barefoot Bob) found a small spot on his tongue mid-last year. It turned out to be cancer. He went through painful surgeries to have part of his tongue and the lymph nodes in his neck removed. This was followed by numerous, difficult radiation treatments. He was only 37 years old.</p>

      <p>When Bob and his doctors finally thought he was cancer free and all that was left was rebuilding his body and learning how to speak and eat again, tumors began to appear around his stomach. The only course of action was a brutal schedule of chemotherapy that seemed to destroy everything in his body but the cancer itself. For a time it looked like an experimental trial conducted at the University of Chicago would at least provide Bob and his family more time together, and Bob had hopes of attending some of the New Year&#8217;s concerts at MSG. Sadly, the trial ended by December, and Bob&#8217;s health quickly declined. Thankfully, he and his family were able to spend one last Christmas together before he passed.</p>

      <p>Bob leaves behind his wife, Danelle, and two sons, Joseph (7 y.o.) and Noah (6 y.o.). No one should have to go through what Bob and his family went through over the last several months, least of all two young boys who can not understand why their father has been taken from them.</p>

      <p><center><img src="/images/family.png" alt="Bob and his family" /></center></p>

      <p>So, it is with a heavy heart but a hopeful spirit that we announce The Robert Eckhart Memorial Fund Charity Raffle and Auction. A number of generous friends and fans have donated some fantastic prints, posters, merchandise and other prizes to spur donations to the trust fund that will help pay for education costs for Joseph and Noah. The rules for the raffle and auction are below, but we encourage you to donate to the Memorial Fund, even if you do not wish to participate in the raffle or auction.</p>

      <p>You can read about Bob&#8217;s courageous battle here (link to caring bridge), and we encourage you to read tributes to Bob from <a href="http://forum.phish.net/thread.php?thread=1357742824">@MJZ1974</a>, <a href="http://phishtlp.com/barefoot-bob_kdh_2013-01-07/">Kevin Hansen</a>, and <a href="http://dsmvibe.com/2013/01/07/may-the-good-lord-shine-a-light-on-you/">Laurie DePhillips</a>, and to leave your own thoughts and memories in this thread (link to Ivy&#8217;s thread).</p>

      <p>Please dig deep, and give generously. That is the way that Bob lived, and you can honor his memory by doing the same.</p>
