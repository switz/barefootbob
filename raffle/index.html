  <h2>RAFFLE RULES</h2>

<p>Entry:</p>

<p>1) Donate a minimum of $20 to the Robert Eckhart Memorial Fund at https://www.wepay.com/donations/317942797.  It is not required, but strongly encouraged, that participants cover the transaction fee as well (2.9% + 30¢ for credit card transactions, 1% + 30¢ for bank transactions).</p>

<p>2) Forward your email receipt to bobmemorial2013@gmail.com.</p>

<p>3) A $20 donation gives you one entry into the raffle. $30 gives you two entries, doubling your odds of winning. Every $10 you donate after that gives you an additional entry. For example, a $100 donation would give you nine entries (or nine times the odds of winning compared to a $20 donation).</p>

<p>4) You may enter as many times as you wish, but only win a maximum of three items.</p>

<p>5) Emails reflecting donations must be received by 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time on January 31, 2013.</p>

<p>Winners: The drawing will be held on February 2nd, 2013.  Winners will be posted in this thread and notified via the email used to send proof of donation.  The first winner can select one prize from the entire prize list, then the second winner will be able to choose from the remaining prizes.  This process will continue until all prizes have been awarded.  Prize selection will be made in the order the names are drawn; if a winner’s name is drawn more than once, they will select their prizes in the drawing order, not all at one time.  Winners will have 24 hours from the time they are emailed with the prize list to respond with their prize selection and shipping information.  If we have not received an email from the winner within 24 hours of the list of available prizes being sent, that winner will be skipped and the next winner on the list will be contacted to select their prize.  If a winner has been skipped and contacts us after the expiration of the 24 hour window, that winner may select a prize once the current winner has made their selection.  This process will continue until all winners have selected a prize.  If a winner does not respond within 7 days, their prize will be forfeit and another winner will be selected.</p>

<p>Shipping: Winners should respond to the email containing the list of available prizes with their selection as well as their ship to information.  Ship to information will be provided to the donor of the prize, who will ship the item(s) to the winner.  For questions/concerns with receipt of prizes, please send an email to bobmemorial2013@gmail.com.</p>
